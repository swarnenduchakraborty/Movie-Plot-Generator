This is our Generative AI and Deep Learning project. Our project is "PlotBot: Your AI Movie Idea Assistant" . 
This app generates movie plot summaries based on a user's input.
We provide a starting phrase or a few keywords, and the AI, which has been fine-tuned on a dataset of movie descriptions (Wikipedia Movie Plots), will complete the thought and generate a plausible movie plot.

Basically it generates the  rest of the movie plot for us with user input.

It has been done through transfer learning and fine tuned.

The app has been made using Streamlit.
